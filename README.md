# Stock-Prediction
This project Predicts Tesla stock prices (TSLA) using multiple supervised machine learning models such as:

- Random Forrest Regressor
- AdaBoost Random Forrest Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor
- Elastic Net Linear Regression

There are numerous visualization graphs used to reperesent the relations between the features.
Since Yahoo Finance was my source of data, the dataset is clean and does not contain any nulls or need any preprocessing. Therefore, I implemented the models directly, and evaluated and compared them to observe the best model to use.
